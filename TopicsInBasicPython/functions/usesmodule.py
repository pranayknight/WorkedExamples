import mymath   #imported from mymath created by me inside the project file so that i can use it in the python files
                #<from mymath import *> Thus by using this we can import all the modules from mymath
print(mymath.sum(10,20))   #after we use above syntax to import all modules we can simply use <print(sum(10,20))> instead
print(mymath.diff(10,5))   #and here we can use <print(diff(10,20))>

#we can also modify the name of imported file by using syntax <import mymath as da> here da is of ur choice
#now instead of using mymath evrywhere we can use its modified name i.e. da
